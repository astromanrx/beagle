## Proof of Signatures (POSIG)
 ### Introduction: Democratizing Blockchain with Proof of Signatures (POSIG)

The emergence of Proof of Stake (PoS) has revolutionized blockchain technology by enabling token holders to create new blocks based on their staked tokens. However, an innovative concept called Proof of Signatures (POSIG) aims to further democratize the blockchain ecosystem and redistribute control from those with substantial token wealth towards trusted community members. POSIG ensures that the creation of new blocks is determined by legitimate users who have garnered significant community support, rather than mere economic stakeholders.

### New Block: A Community-Based Approach

Under POSIG, a new block candidate arises when it successfully garners enough signatures from trusted and vetted members of the community. These legitimate users possess a keyless account linked to their Google accounts, ensuring secure access without reliance on private keys. Each user holds a minimum amount of specified tokens to establish themselves as eligible signatories, preventing multiple validations by different nodes at the same block height.

### Legit User: Keyless Accounts and Token Requirements

A legitimate user in POSIG possesses a keyless account, which is associated with their Google account. This eliminates the need for private keys while enhancing security measures by allowing transactions to be processed through wallet addresses linked to their online identity. To qualify as a legitimate signer, users must hold a minimum amount of tokens that are predefined in the POSIG protocol.

### The Signing Process: Utilizing Stamp Software

To participate in signing scrolls, signers are required to install an essential software tool known as "Stamp." This application serves as an interface between users and their chosen nodes within the blockchain network. Whenever a node proposes a new scroll for validation, the Stamp software digitally sign the proposed scroll using their user private key.

By leveraging POSIG, we can foster an inclusive and community-driven approach to blockchain governance, empowering users who are trusted by their peers rather than relying solely on token wealth. This innovative concept brings us one step closer towards a more equitable and decentralized future for blockchain technology.
